# SLAM
Personal projects extending a State Estimation course I took

With an understanding of Kalman and Particle filters under my belt, I would now like to apply them to the SLAM problem. I figured starting with an EKF SLAM would have been redundant, so I chose to implement the FastSLAM algorithm propsed in Sebastian Thrun's Probabilistic Robotics.  I started with a naive approach to FastSLAM with known data association, wanting to write simple code first and then grow in complexity.

To put it very simply, FastSLAM factors the SLAM problem into two terms. An estimate of the path, and based on that, estimates of the landmarks. Together, they can be solved by a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter. The particles are used to estimate the state of the robot, and each particle contains low dimensional EKFs for the state of the landmarks.

I found that the proposal distribution generated by the motion model was not accurate and precise enough relative to the measurment model. This meant that very few particles were receiving a high importance weight. I addressed this by incorporating the measurment into the proposal distribution. I will add a picture to explain this better.

Next I will be implementing the maximum likelihood data association to solve problems with unknown data association.
